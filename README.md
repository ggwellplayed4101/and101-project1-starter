## Overview

### Description

Hello Squirrel is a playful profile card app that displays a user‚Äôs name, biography, and favorite hobbies. It‚Äôs the first project in my Android dev journey, built using Kotlin and XML with some sweet visual customizations.

### App Evaluation

|-----------|--------|
| **Category** | Profile Card / Social |
| **Mobile** | Built specifically for Android (Kotlin + XML) |
| **Story** | User sees a stylized personal profile on launch |
| **Market** | Anyone who wants to share who they are in app form |
| **Habit** | One-time use, primarily for learning & demoing |
| **Scope** | Entry-level app, fully functional, visually personalized |

(Since this was a layout-focused project, no pre-drawn wireframes were used.)

_If I had one, it would show a profile picture on top, name and bio underneath, followed by a hobbies list._
